# Toronto-Rain-Prediction-

Have you ever looked at the weather forecast the day before traveling for vacation so that you can pack the relevant clothing needed only for the forecast to be wrong? Imagine rerading a forecast that states sunny skies, only to observe rain or snow the following day. Would you be caught off guard without an umbrella or snow pants? In the following project we seek to find a better way to forecast weather, minimizing the chances of a person to be caught off guard, unprepared for the weather of a given day.

Goal: Predict the presence of precipitation 1 day in the future.

Data was collected from Environment and Climate Change Canada. The data comes from the weather station at Pearson International Airport which updates the weather measurement every 5 minutes.  Each individual reading is then taken and aggregated by day to output daily weather measurements.

This project was done in collaberation with 2 other people as the term project of a Machine Learning course. The file "Final - Toronto Rain Preditcion" was the cumulative work done between members of the group. The file "Final - Toronto Rain Preditcion (Updated Notebook - Project Recommendations)" takes the work done by the group, adds the corrects suggested by the course professor and adds further feature engineer to invetsigate ideas that weren't previously thought of in the group setting.
